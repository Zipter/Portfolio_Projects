# Used Cars' Price & Trim Prediction

### Project: 
Predicting dealer listing prices and trim of used cars

### Description: 
In this repository, I showcase my abilities in the implementation of various algorithms and models using Python, to predict the dealer listing prices (continuous variable) and trim (categorical variable) of used cars. The project features a Jupyter notebook illustrating my expertise in building and evaluating machine learning models for classification and regression tasks. The target variables are predicted through the use of 26 labelled predictors of different nature, being numerical, boolean, and categorical, the latter ranging from simple strings, to semi-structured strings lists, and to unstructured text. Through the use of scikit-learn, I have developed two models, a random forest one and an xgboost one, that demonstrate my understanding of feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation. The notebook also includes explanatory comments and the repository includes a business report, underscoring my ability to communicate complex concepts and solutions effectively.
