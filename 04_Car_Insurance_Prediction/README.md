# Insurance Claims Prediction

### Project: 
Model the expected claim amount per policyholder and per year based on customers’ risk characteristics.

### Description: 
<p>
In this notebook I showcase my skills in tackling a data science project which focuses on the explorative data analysis and modeling of a sparse dataset.<br>
The datasets are public and can be found in the following links: https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=41214&status=active and https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=41215&status=active <br>
They list different customers’ risk characteristics and their past claimed amounts.<br>
The goal of the case study is to predict the future claim amounts per policyholder and per year based on the customers’ risk characteristics.<br>
After the phases of data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering, the best strategy presented in this notebook to predict the target variable, consists of a first classification model and a subsequent regression model, mimicking the concept of a Hurdle modle. <br>
The classification model predicts if the claim amount is going to be zero or higher than zero. The regression model will improve the positive claim amount predictions.<br>
I conclude the notebook with a summary of the results and possible next steps.<br>
