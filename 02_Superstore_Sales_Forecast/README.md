# Time Series Analysis

### Project: 
Sales data analysis and forecasting

### Description: 
In this notebook, I demonstrate my skills in analysing a time series data set. The data describes the sales activity of a supermarket chain in the US over a four-year period, from January 2015 to December 2018. The first part of the study consists of a explorative data analysis, by looking at how sales are distributed across the different Regions, States, Cities, product categories and sub-categories to get an overview of how the supermarket performed in the time span of the dataset. In a second section, I used statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.STL to develop a model by decomposing the sales data into its seasonal and trend components using LOESS. The model is then used to forecast sales revenue in 2019. The notebook also includes explanatory comments and a summary of key findings, which emphasises my ability to effectively communicate complex concepts and solutions.
