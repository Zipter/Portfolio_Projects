# Used Cars' Price & Trim Prediction
Portfolio Project Implementing ML Models in Python

### Project: 
Predicting dealer listing prices and trim of used cars

### Description: 
In this repository, I showcase my abilities in the implementation of various algorithms and models using Python to predict the dealer listing prices and trim of used cars. The project features a Jupyter notebook illustrating my expertise in building and evaluating machine learning models for classification and regression tasks. Through the use of scikit-learn, I have developed two models, a random forest one and an xgboost one, that demonstrate my understanding of feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation. The repository also includes explanatory comments and a business report, underscoring my ability to communicate complex concepts and solutions effectively.

### Notes:
Additional updates are planned.
