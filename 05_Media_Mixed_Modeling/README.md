### Project: 
Understand the true impact of a marketing campaign on app daily installations.

### Description: 
<p>
In this notebook I showcase my skills in tackling a data science project which focuses on the analysis and modeling of a time series dataset.<br>
The goal of the case study is to understand the true impact of a marketing campaign on a client app daily installations.<br>
After data cleaning, feature engineering and the EDA phases, to predict the daily installations number, I train a multivariate linear regression model through the available predictors and newly created ones. 
A seasonality patter analysis is conducted on the data through a LOESS analysis. The seasonality pattern is then included in the final model. <br>
I conclude the notebook with a summary of the results and possible next steps.<br>
